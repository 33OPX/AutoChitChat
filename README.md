# Chat Automation Extension

‚ú® **Automate Your Chat Interactions!**

This Chrome extension automates chat interactions by skipping inactive chats or chats containing specific keywords (`M`, `m`, or `male`). It also includes a 30-second inactivity timer to skip chats with no activity. A pause/play toggle button allows you to control the script's execution.

## üîß Features

## üîÑ How It Works

- The script scans chat messages for specific keywords (`M`, `m`, or `male`).
- If a keyword is found, it skips the chat by clicking **SKIP**, **CONFIRM?**, and **START** buttons.

### Inactivity Timer
- If no messages are sent in a chat for 30 seconds, the script skips the chat automatically.

### Pause/Play Toggle
- Click the **Turn OFF** button to pause the script.
- Click the **Turn ON** button to resume the script.
